## Liquid Haskell

* Haskell extension
* Adds refinement/dependent types via code annotations
* Refinement types allow us to prove certain properties of our code that we cannot prove in standard Haskell
* Advantage: Full benefits of refinement/dependent types while maintaining source compatibility. Compare with Idris, which needs redevelopment of all libraries. 
* Constraint satisfaction
